## The Code Alchemist of Multiverses 🔮💻

I'm a computer science educator with a passion for crafting worlds where code meets creativity. Whether it's building an anime-inspired ergonomic app, developing WPF desktop apps with encrypted SQLite databases, or designing an isekai-themed adventure game to teach programming — I blend fantasy with function like a true digital storyteller. 🎮✨

My toolkit? Dart, C#, Python, Kotlin, Rust, and even a sprinkle of R when theory calls. From expert systems to mobile apps, from static Jekyll sites to Wuthering Waves content on Instagram — I'm not just coding, I build experiences across dimensions. 🌐⚔️

I'm equal parts educator, developer, designer, and content creator — with an eye on both the academic and the practical, always expanding my skills while keeping the fun alive.
