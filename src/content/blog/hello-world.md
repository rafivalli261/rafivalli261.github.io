Welcome to my blog! This is the first post.

I built this site with [Astro](https://astro.build) — a static site generator that keeps things fast and simple. Posts are written in plain Markdown, so adding new content is as easy as creating a new file.

## What to expect

I plan to write about things I find interesting: programming, tools I use, things I'm learning, and the occasional opinion.

## A code example

Here's a quick taste of what posts might look like:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

That's it for now. More posts coming soon.
