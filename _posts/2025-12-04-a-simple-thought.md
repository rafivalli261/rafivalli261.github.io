<!-- school, work -->
When I was child, I used to think that grown up is a good thing.  A few years later, I realize that I was wrong. There are various things one must do when he or she is already a grown up. They have to do the things regardless what they want or else some consequences must be face. These are side of story from my experiences. The terms revolve around working, studying, playing, etc.

I did experienced a lot of changes by going to school. While most of them were not a fond memories, a few of them is enough to make me wants to go to school again. Initially, I went to school just to not get bored, and every parents in the world must have sent their child to school if they see it fit. Depending on the teacher who runs the class and the subject study, learners can definetely agree or disagree with the ideas of sitting in a class for around 10 hours from monday to saturday, so am I. Later, I found that learning in class is somewhat to force you to learn some basic skills with structured lesson plan. This is agreeable for beginners, but when someone has reached another level of understanding, sitting in a class becomes useless. The more accurate ways were self-learning which need the understanding of basic or initial concept beforehand.
