Music has always played a significant role in human society. Since the earliest civilizations, it has been closely linked with cultural identity and expression. Every country in the world possesses at least one national song that symbolizes its heritage. Classical music, in particular, reflects the creativity of composers of its era and is often associated with relaxation and refinement. In modern times, music with lyrics can also serve educational purposes, such as assisting people in learning languages in an enjoyable manner.

However, not all forms of music are universally celebrated. One controversial phenomenon in Indonesia is “horeg sound,” a type of extremely loud music often played at public gatherings, convoys, or street celebrations. Derived from the Javanese word for “vibrate,” horeg refers to powerful audio systems that produce sound levels as high as 135 decibels. While enthusiasts consider it entertaining, critics argue that it causes significant disturbances, ranging from health risks such as hearing damage to structural damage in surrounding areas.

The debate over horeg reflects wider tensions between cultural expression and public welfare. Although some communities enjoy it as a form of entertainment, its negative impacts on health and social order suggest the need for stricter regulation. A balanced approach would allow individuals to enjoy music without compromising the well-being of others.
