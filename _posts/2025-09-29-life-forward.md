# Life Forward
Hello, I'm back writing this blog after several months inactive. There is sudden surge for me to start writing, especially when I have been completed my study in computer science education master program. Yes, Finally after so long (well, it is actually take 1 year though), I got my M.Ed degree. Yet, I firmly believe that this is not the end (of cource, I need job after all). There is still opportinity that have not been in my reach. For the bright future, I have to do something about it such as scholarship. My first goal would be decide where to go next, prepare for the upcoming test, and take as many side job as I can.

## Where to *next*?
> "Life is still long" -> say someone who already got a job and someone who is a princess of a businessman
Of course, I do know what they meant to said. Yet, I still believe one needed to do things as fast as possible. For a brute simplification, Life is like a visual novel with complex decision making. With as many mistakes as player make, They may discover a way out toward the desirable route. Yet, some path cannot be repeated and just need to be remembered as a lesson. The process of obtaining the desirable route may take forever, but one can speed up the process by taking a walktrough. That just what I think of life. I still need to take as many _walktrough_ as I can in order to reach the desirable ending for myself without sacrificing much time. My advice is that life may not be full on happiness, but one can still squeeze delight out of it. The biggest question next is, _what kind of route should one need?_

## Prepare for next test
For upcoming events, I need to prepare so many things such as communication skill (which I sucked at), excellent AI knowledge, healty body, strong will, excellent resume, motivation letter, official English test score, etc. I am a bit confused on what to do know.

## Take many side job
This is obvious. English test is not cheap after all. I also need to prepare documents which again required the neccessary.
