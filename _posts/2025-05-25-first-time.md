## First of All
I would like to thank you if you are somehow stumbled upon this particular post. The reason for me to write this is none other than to practice on writing something in english. Once again not because I like it but because of job's requirement. Not that my job is special or something, I thought every job has it's own difficulties including mine. However, let's just follow the road and let things happen naturally (with a little push).

### What is this?
The place is about storing my porfolio and personal wiki. I hope you like the contents because it is what it is. If not, you can always reach me on my social media or email. I always open for critique or advice. At the current time, my portfolio isn't that many because I often forgot to write down my older projects to a structured and and presentable format. I fell remorse about not doing that on the first place. In the world that demand skills than degree, you must have something to show it. That is where the portfolio comes in handy. The wiki is just the same. If I had to write every special thing in a note, I can probaly publish books by now.

### The next project
C# Coding Project
The Monte Carlo articles
"I am Your Sweetest Dream and your enemies worst nighmare" ~ basically a plot for story
