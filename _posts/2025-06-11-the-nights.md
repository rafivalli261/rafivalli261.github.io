I have works to do. So, I will just write a few sentences. Life is boring sometimes. It makes me want to do more, but It seems that I can't keep up with the job. There is one job that I don't know how can I get it done at the time. Another job needs creativity, but you know me, my creativity have been dead since I don't know when. I should attach some chat with GPT for the clearer information. The research job which the main job for me also was a disaster. I'm doing it but I think my work speed seems to be so slow. Furthermore, the task doesn't know limits and because of that I feel pressured to focus my whole life in it. There are 3 papers I should working on that doesn't have anything to do with my graduate thesis (I am studying master, Yes). Besides that, I also working on 2 papers which is directly relate to my thesis and a thesis itself. I'm also waiting for the payment from a project that have been done recently. It is quite a big project and the money is sufficient enough. Its already two weeks without any mention of payment. I still hope to get paid handsomely though. Apart from works, I also need self-improvement like my communication skills, my reading skills, my research skills, my english skills, my creative skills, my gaming skill, my programming skill, my bussiness skill, etc.

Yeah, somethimes my mind went wild as the task goes on. The bright side is I have more experience to level up. Yeay. Even though it is frustrating, I'm doing it because I love it.

In Advance, before I forgot, I apologize if this is not what you meant, but this is what I feel and it is what happen in my mind. It maybe has nothing to do with your communiation skill. If you ever read this, consider I'm crazy or whatever. Well, if you feel this is unimportant then forget it. There re a lot of choices in this tiny world.
