# Quality of Game

Video games or game in short is an ertertainment meant to please people from stressing workplace. Some of you maybe disagree and game roles in everyday life did change over the time. People were not playing just for fun anymore. Some game can generate money while the others are sucking money from its player base without them noticing. Gambling addiction and rage quit could be the usual case in some games. Other players are into competitive game, meaning that they challenge others to win matches. In children, gaming addiction could have severe effect on their development which will cause problems for themself and their kin in the future. So, did video games only exhibit detrimental perks to people? Of course not, there are a bunch of positive impact that can be reach by using video games. Like I said earlier, there is a kind of games that doesn't mean to entertain people but to educate them. This so called serious games are develop by researchers for the sake of education. Medical schools are expensive partly because they use real life object for practice with limited trial. Meanwhile in serious game, they can basically do surgery simulations with low cost in unlimited times. Underwater welding practice in real life would highly difficult but it can get easier using serious games. Simulations in any given condition could be done with serious game. Other than that, studies stated that playing open world games could indeed reduce stress. There are alot to discuss about video games but I just want to highlight one particular aspect of video games which is the Quality. There are a lot of debate in this area especially when many elements are being considered, such as story, music/sound, visual graphic, gameplay, etc. In my opinion, there are 3 main points to consider about game quality which are performance, audio visual representation, and story narative.
